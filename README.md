# Photo Edit App

I developed a photo edit app with minimalistic features, including scale images, rotate images, resize and apply filters. 

Users can upload an image, and then select from the available features to edit their image. The processed image is then displayed on the client side, where users can download or continue editing. 

The app was implemented using Python, Express.js, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
